**Python script** to send **random HTTP requests**, to *hide* your traffic and **confuse your ISP/VPN**. Your web traffic will be cheaper to sell and useless for ads. Your traffic will look weird and hard to identify, what you browse and are interested in.

Libraries to install: `pip install requests`

How to install the project: `git clone https://github.com/QL0R/Traffic-Confuser.git`

Usage: `python3 traffic-confuser.py`

You can edit the sample.txt file to other websites you want.

Support on **Linux** (The code would work on Windows and MAC as well if you edit it that way. I might make a **Windows version** in the *future* !)

# How does it work?

Basically it sends HTTP requests to random websites, the websites are stored in the `.sample.txt` file, (you can add more websites in it, modify it). The script chooses what website to open randomly,
the time periods betweeen requests are also random: 
you can set it to be slower/faster ex.: `random.randint(20,50)` for fast (not recommended since some websites might block you) or `random.randint(40,180)` for slow, looks more realistic (recommended).

You can run it in the background on your daily browsing (consider *adding more websites* to `.sample.txt`) 

*Note: give it a try running it again if you encounter any errors.*
